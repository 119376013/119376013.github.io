		<p id= "dist-para"> Gartner describes Distributed cloud as the distribution of public cloud services to different physical locations, while the operation, governance, updates 
		and evolution of the services are the responsibility of the originating public cloud provider.<br /> <br />Distributed cloud computing expands the traditional, large data center-based 
		cloud model to a set of distributed cloud infrastructure components that are geographically dispersed. Distributed cloud computing continues to offer on-demand scaling of computing and 
		storage while moving it closer to where these are needed for improved performance. <br /><br />Edge computing is a complementary aspect of distributed cloud computing, and represents the 
		farthest end of a distributed cloud architecture. Edge computing is a solution where data is processed as close as possible to the place where it is generated. Applications that can 
		benefit from edge computing are those where low latency and high throughput are critical, or where it is too expensive to send the data back to a distant cloud for processing
